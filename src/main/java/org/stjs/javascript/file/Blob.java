 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
 * 
 * A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs
 * represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File
 * interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to
 * support files on the user's system.
 * 
 * To construct a Blob from other non-blob objects and data, use the Blob()
 * constructor. To create a blob that contains a subset of another blob's data,
 * use the slice() method. To obtain a Blob object for a file on the user's file
 * system, see the File documentation.
 * 
 * The APIs accepting Blob objects are also listed on the File documentation.
